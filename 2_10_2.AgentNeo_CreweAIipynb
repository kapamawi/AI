If the user or system did not consistently choose \"Content Creation\" when it was the only relevant tool, this would contribute to the low correctness rate.\\n\\n3. **Overuse of Other Tools**: The high number of total calls (20) compared to the single correct call indicates that there was a significant overuse of tools that were not intended for the task. This could imply a lack of focus on the specific goal of content creation, resulting in many irrelevant or incorrect actions.\\n\\nIn summary, the low correctness rate reflects a failure to consistently utilize the intended tool for the specific task, leading to a high number of incorrect calls relative to the total attempts.',\n",
